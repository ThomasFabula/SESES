Abstract
The current state of-and future plans for-the microelectro mechanical CAD system SESES developed 
at the ETH Zurich are presented. The algorithmic requirements for the numerical modelling of 
microelectromechanical (MEM) devices are presented with reference to six important modelling problems.
Numerical results are given for an electrostatic comb actuator.
